  Data structures in one of important topic in computer science.Data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.
  We can use data structures component such as **arrays,linkedlist,stack,queue,heap,tree,time complexity** intensely while we write operation system. But except these each system has abstract data structures. For example, web, mobile,game systems etc. So, we have to learn data structures to get and organized efficient data.
